# Introduction to GO by Caleb Doxsey

## Chapter 4: Control Structures

### Key Takeaways
- The For loop in Go, this is the only looping construct in Go and I think this is awesome. Hmm, am I right?

- The If and Switch statements.

- Something learned out of scope for this chapter is the various ways to print in the fmt package.  
`Println` adds a newline - _`\n`_ character.  
`Print` prints as is and doesn't append anything.  
`Printf` allows for formatting of variables or type literals into certain symbols and still doesn't print any character after.
