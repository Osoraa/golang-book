# Introduction to GO by Caleb Doxsey

## Chapter 2: Types

### Key Takeaways
- Most obvious types in GO are Numbers, Strings and Booleans.  
Numbers generally consist of Integers, Floats, and Complexes not sure if there are any more.

- Integers are signed and unsigned, just like in C and are nicely named with how many bits they use.  
Signed integers are - **int8, int16, int32 and int64**.  
Unsigned integers are - **uint8, uint16, uint32 and uint64**. 

- Two helpful aliases are **byte** for *uint8* and **rune** for *int32*.

- Floats have single and double precision verions: **float32** and **float64**. **float64** is generally favoured when using floats.

- Complex numbers include **complex64** and **complex128**.

- Go supports the standard arithmetic operators.

- Strings can be created with either double-quotes or back-ticks.

- Booleans are **OR**, **AND**, and **NOT** which are denoted by **||**, **&&**, and **!** respectively, just like in most other languages.  
**true** and **false** are also reserved keywords in the Go Programming language.
